Do you have roommates or people that live just a wall or two away? Are you a chronic night owl?
If so, you’ve probably run into issues keeping yourself quiet late at night when having fun with your fellow insomniacs.  Luckily for you there is a hot new app floating around to manage your late-night outbursts.

Introducing Silent Owl!

Silent Owl uses your computer’s microphone to monitor your volume and provides audio feedback to your headphones in the event of a loud noise.

If the noise level goes over the limit, a warning sound is played in your headset device.
